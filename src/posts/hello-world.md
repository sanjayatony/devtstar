Hello world.

I challenge myself to use Vim to built all of this stuff. So I built this some kind of blog using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). Surprisingly it was so simple.

## devtstar

First I named this project Vegapunk. If you are One Piece fans, you will know who is it. But I want to show my self as a developer and then an image of Death Star pass to my time line. So Dev + Death Star = devtstar.

So fuck yea, devtstar is born.
