Hello world.

I challenge myself to use Vim to built all of this stuff. So I built this a some kind of blog using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). Surprisingly it was so simple.

## devtstar

First I named this project **Vegapunk**. If you are a One Piece fan, you will know who is it. But I want to show myself as a developer and then an image of Death Star suddenly flying to my timeline. So Dev + Death Star = devtstar it is.

So fuck yea, devtstar is born.
